# Hotel Booking Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Hotel Booking Dataset**. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to hotel reservations, cancellations, guest preferences, and seasonality factors.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of hotel booking records, including details on reservation status, lead time, arrival dates, customer demographics, and other relevant features.

## Tools Used
The following tools and libraries were used to perform the analysis:
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and feature engineering (if applicable)

## Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and duplicate removal.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Visualizing booking trends
   - Seasonal patterns and customer behavior
   - Cancellation trends and influencing factors


## Insights & Findings
- Seasonal trends significantly affect hotel bookings, with peak times observed in specific months.
- Certain factors such as lead time, deposit type, and customer type influence cancellation rates.
- Booking patterns vary between **City Hotels** and **Resort Hotels**.
